I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence.  I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else.

Q:
Of course, I will add the option to edit the description of the task. For every task, I will add the UX for adding subtasks, to complete to big task.
Another thing to add is target date to finish the task, and reminders id needed.
I think that it will be easy to figure out the flow in the first usage, because there is not going to be a lot of buttons and options the the app.
The flow will be diect, and easy to unterstand.
It's not going to be hard to implement. Just need to add another button to the holder, for changing the text (or mabye go to another activity when pressing 
the button.)
This flow is consistent with regular edis flows. I checked few apps( google task for example), and this flow is very similar.
